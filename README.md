Venice Boat Classification
MarDCT /Maritime Images for Classification data set which has contains a training set and test set using the deep learning concept with (CNN) in our project in order to get high performance and good accuracy .
Deep Learning is becoming a very popular subset of machine learning due to its high level of performance across many types of data. A great way to use deep learning to classify images is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN). The Keras library in Python makes it pretty simple to build a CNN.
Computers see images using pixels. Pixels in images are usually related. For example, a certain group of pixels may signify an edge in an image or some other pattern. Convolutions use this to help identify images.
